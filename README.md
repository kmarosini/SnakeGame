# SnakeGame
This is a Java project that implements a game engine using the MVC design pattern. It includes a graphical user interface created with JavaFX, multithreading, thread implementation, synchronization, and advanced libraries to fetch and process data asynchronously. The application also allows the user to save the state of the game on disk using serialization and restart it from the previous state using deserialization. The game engine also supports network communication and enables playing the game online. The game configuration can be saved in XML format using the SAX/DOM libraries.

Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later installed on your system. Clone this repository to your local machine and open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Features
MVC Design Pattern: The project follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern to separate the concerns of the application into three different components.

Graphical User Interface: The project includes a graphical user interface created using JavaFX. It enables the user to use the application with ease and follows the best practices of graphical interface design.

Multithreading and Synchronization: The application uses multithreading and synchronization with advanced libraries to fetch and process data asynchronously.

Serialization and Deserialization: The project supports the saving of the game's state on disk using serialization and the restarting of the game from the previous state using deserialization.

Network Communication: The project supports network communication, enabling users to play the game online. Player move data is sent using UDP protocols, and socket communication is implemented using threads. JNDI and RMI technologies are used to implement the selection of teammates in games and communication ("chat") for the duration of games.

XML Configuration: The project supports the saving of the game configuration in XML format using the SAX/DOM libraries. It implements dynamic reading and writing of data into XML files.

Usage

To use the application, run the HelloApplication. The graphical user interface will appear, allowing the user to play the game. To save the game's state, click the "Save" button. To restart the game from the previous state, click the "Load" button.
